# *computing-work*

Teachers are hardworking and patient
filled with determination and dedication  
always gracious, inspirational and caring

You were sent to teach us and
to help us to comprehend
and will continue till the end

Education the teachers start
we absorb the knowledge that they provide
better versions of ourselves we become

You developed us with pride
so we can decide
how to live life
and to abide by law's side

If we sidetrack
You never slack
only getting us back on the track
Though you may get heart attacks :)

You may have thought you were merely teaching
When you were helping to eliminate fear
soon from my life you shall disappear
but i will never forget your teachings that I hold dear

The letters on the piece of paper 
Shows your dedication and motivation
For us, Dunmanians
And this we shall never forget
